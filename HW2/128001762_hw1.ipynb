    "*Goals of this homework:* Understand the vector space model (TF-IDF, cosine) + BM25 works in searching. Explore real-world challenges of building a graph (in this case, from Epinions), implement and test the classic HITS algorithm over this graph. Experiment with real-world search engine optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission instructions (eCampus):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw1.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw1.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the 5 total allotted to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: I found helpful code on stackoverflow at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz that helped me solve Problem 2.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we're going to adapt the classic HITS approach to allow us to find not the most authoritative web pages, but rather to find the most trustworthy users. [Epinions.com](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Epinions1.html) is a general consumer review site with a who-trust-whom online social network. Members of the site can decide whether to ''trust'' each other. All the trust relationships interact and form the Web of Trust which is then combined with review ratings to determine which reviews are shown to the user. (Refer to: Richardson, Matthew, Rakesh Agrawal, and Pedro Domingos. \"Trust management for the semantic web.\" International semantic Web conference. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2003.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of viewing the world as web pages with hyperlinks (where pages = nodes, hyperlinks = edges), we're going to construct a graph of Epinions users and their \"trust\" on other users (so user = node, trust behavior = edge). Over this Epinions-user graph, we can apply the HITS approach to order the users by their hub-ness and their authority-ness.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to download the *Epinions_trust.txt* file from the Resources tab on Piazza. Each line represents the trust relationship between two users. Here is a toy example. Suppose you are given the following four lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* diane trust bob\n",
    "* charlie trust bob \n",
    "* charlie trust alice\n",
    "* bob trust charlie\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"trust\" between each user pair denotes a directed edge between two nodes. E.g., the \"diane\" node has a directed edge to the \"bob\" node (as indicated by the first line). \n",
    "\n",
    "You should build a graph by parsing the data in the file we provide called *Epinions_trust.txt*. (Note: The edges are binary and directed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The edges are binary and directed.\n",
    "* User can't trust himself/herself.\n",
